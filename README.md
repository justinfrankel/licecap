## Build with Visual Studio 2010 or later

1. clone the source code to a folder of your choosing
2. open `licecap.sln` from the subfolder `licecap\licecap` inside the working copy - newer VS versions may convert the project to their respective format
3. build either the `Debug` or the `Release` configuration
4. find the resulting `.exe` file in a subfolder of the folder containing the solution file named `Debug_new` and `Release_new` respectively
