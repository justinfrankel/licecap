# LICEcap
_simple animated screen captures_

![licecap demo animation](/docs/licecap_rules.gif)

LICEcap can capture an area of your desktop and save it directly to .GIF (for viewing in web browsers, etc) or .LCF (see below).

LICEcap is an intuitive but flexible application (for Windows and now OSX), that is designed to be lightweight and function with high performance.

LICEcap is easy to use: [view a demo](/docs/how_to_licecap.gif) (output is [here](/docs/demo2.gif)).

In addition to .GIF, LICEcap supports its own native lossless .LCF file format, which allows for higher compression ratios than .GIF, higher quality (more than 256 colors per frame), and more accurate timestamping. If you record to .LCF, you can play back the .LCF files within [REAPER](http://www.reaper.fm) (and/or use it to convert to .gif or another video format).

## License ##

LICEcap is GPL free software, each download package includes the source.

## Features and Options ##

  * Move the screen capture frame while recording.
  * Pause and restart recording, with optional inserted text messages.
  * Global hotkey (shift+space) to toggle pausing while recording
  * Adjustable maximum recording framerate, to allow throttling CPU usage.
  * Basic title frame, with or without text.

## Requirements ##

* For Windows: Windows XP/Vista/7 (might work with reduced functionality on other versions)
